This page helps you get started with the Open Voice Factory.  

In time for our Beta release, we've got four videos. 


## Getting started 

This is our three minute getting started video. It is a single take shown at normal speed and without cuts. It shows how you can download the templates, make changes, and upload them again to create an online communcation app.
