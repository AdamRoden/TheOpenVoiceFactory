The Open Voice Factory converts communication boards into communication devices.

Anyone can create an aid by editing a PowerPoint template to add their one pages or utterances.  When you upload your template to the factory, it will create a working communication aid for you. 

The resulting programs run on any platform, from tablets to laptops to phones, without installation or complex setup.

Everything we make is free.  That’s free as in ‘don’t pay for it’ and free as in speech.  All of our code is freely available on github [here](https://github.com/joereddington/TheOpenVoiceFactory) and anyone can change or repurpose without having to ask us first. We’re supported by the volunteers who write the code, create the templates and help out all over. 

The sections below let you play with our demos, have a go at creating your own, and find out how you can help.
